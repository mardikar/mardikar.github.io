# **Round 1 - Online assessment**
+ Some question related to heap data structure
+ Sorting the log - <https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-data-in-log-files/>, some variation of this question

I was told within an hour that I'm selected for next round. <br>
Round 2, 3 and 4 happened all on same day. <br>
I was given 10 days of time after Round 1 for these 3 rounds. <br>
First round was 10:30 - 11:30 AM, second from 12:30 till 1:45 PM and third from 2 to 3:15 PM.

# **Round 2 - Problem-solving**

+ Asked to introduce myself
+ Asked about time when I took the initiative to improve the process. - LP question
+ Find the first-non repeating character in a stream of characters. Similar to this <https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/>
+ Think you are a compiler, you are supposed to resolve the import statements.For example,
    Inside module A: <br>
    A imports B <br>
    B imports C <br>
    Then for A to work it needs to resolve the dependencies i.e. A => B  => C. <br>
    I wrote a DFS based approach and the interviewer asked few questions to make sure, I have covered all the edge cases.
+ Asked if I have any questions.

	
# **Round 3 - Problem-solving**

+ Asked to introduce myself
+ There are "p" people sitting in a circular arrangement among whom you are supposed to distribute the cake, you have p-1 cakes and you are supposed to give cake to every "N"th person , once you give cake to someone they are taken out of the seating arrangement, you are supposed to find out the person who will not get the cake after p-1 iterations. 
    + I tried to see if I can find pattern and come up with formula to get it done in O(1) - spent 3-4 mins
    + Then I went ahead with circular linked list based approach
 + "prefix" and a "dictionary of words" were given, you were supposed to find out all the words from dictionary that start prefix and have 2 more letters in them. <br>
    For example: <br>
        Words = ["abcde", "abc", "abcdf", "abcbdcc"] <br>
        Prefix = "abc" <br>
        Output = ["abcde", "abcdf"] <br>
    I replied with a trie based approach and the interviewer asked me to extend it to "k" letters instead "2". Since we were already 15 mins over the scheduled time, I just told him the modifications that I would do to fit in "k" letters.
+ Asked if I have any questions.
